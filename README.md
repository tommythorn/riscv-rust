# Virturve

Virturve is a virtual [RISC-V](https://riscv.org/) processor
and peripheral devices emulator project written in Rust and
compilable to WebAssembly.

This is a substantially enhanced fork of [Takahiro's riscv-rust
original emulator](https://github.com/takahirox/riscv-rust).  This
fork is already far more complete and is working towards near 100%
correctness.  Ultimately, we also expect it to become substantially
faster, but this work is delayed until this is sufficiently correct to
run benchmarks and off-the-shelf Linux distributions.

## Online Demo

You can run Linux on the emulator in your browser. [Online demo is
here](https://tommythorn.github.io/virturve/wasm/web/index.html)

## Features

- Emulate RISC-V RV64GC_Zba_Zicond processor and peripheral devices (virtio block
  device and a UART)
- Also runnable in browser with WebAssembly
- Runnable locally
- Debugger

## Instructions/Features support status

- [x] RV64IMAC
- [x] RV64FD (*PARTIALLY* flags/rounding modes very lacking)
- [x] RV64Zifencei
- [x] RV64Zicsr
- [ ] RV64B (Zicond and Zba done)
- [ ] Svnapot
- [x] CSR (mostly done)
- [x] Sv39
- [x] Sv48 (untested, but should work)
- [x] Privileged instructions
- [ ] PMP (this is intensionally not implemented as it will negatively affect performance)

The emulator supports all instructions listed above but some 

- Boots Buildroot and Debian Trixie
- Linux OpenSBI and legacy BBL boot support

### Current Known Issues

- gdb, rustc, and Geekbench segfaults
- Ubuntu boot crashes and hangs
- Debian boot sees non-fatal crashes
- U-boot loads but hangs before hand-off


## How to run Linux

```sh
$ cargo b -r --all
$ target/release/ ../resources/linux/opensbi/fw_payload.elf -f ../resources/linux/rootfs.img
```

## How to run riscv-tests

Prerequirements
- Install [riscv-gnu-toolchain](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain)
- Install [riscv-tests](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-tests)

```sh
$ cd riscv-rust/cli
$ cargo run $path_to_riscv_tets/isa/rv64ui-p-add -n
```

### xv6-riscv

[xv6-riscv](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-riscv) is the RISC-V port
of [xv6](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2019/xv6.html) which is UNIX
V6 rewritten by MIT for x86 in the current C language.
